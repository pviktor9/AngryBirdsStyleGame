# Game Project Pitch Information

## Requirements for Project Pitches

Your pitches should consist of slide-based presentations that last 3 minutes. You may designate a represtative to give the pitch for your team or you may have multiple team members participate.

You should explain the following in your pitch:
* The succinct core game idea (i.e. make your game compelling in 30 seconds of talking with the one-sentene pitch displayed).
* Explain why your game is novel or why it should be made.
* Situate your game with respect to existing games and/or genres.
* How feasible is this project with respect to the restrictions of this class.
* Explain who is in your target audience and why they are the targets.


### How to get credit?

Basic criteria:
1 Give the pitch.
2 Meet all of the requirements listed above
3 Submit your slidedeck with presentation notes to the shared folder given to you via official course communication channels.

To do even better:
* Make the pitch as close to 3 minutes as possible.
  * Productive use every second of the allocated to you. (If this were a pitch to a publisher, you would not want to waste a single second or direspect their time by take more than was grated.)
* Make slides that can stand on their own without relying on a lot of bullet points or text. 
* Slides should augment what you are saying and should not distract from it.
* Do not be vague or shallow in your explainations in the pitch. 
* Tell a coherent story.
* Presentation skills: fluid slide deliver, loud and clear speach, make eye contact with the audience, etc.
* Practice :)
* Integrate concepts from earlier in the course into your presented content.

## What is a Game Pitch?

Game pitches come in a few formats: 1 sentence, 30 second, 2 minute, and ~5-15 minute visual presentations. 
The goal of a game pitch is to communicate the novel, exciting, and desirable aspects of your game design vision to particular audience.
Basically, your task is to effectively commmunicate a value proposition.
Often, these audiences are producers, funders, juries, or some other people who are looking to find the best of many pitches.

## Key Features of a Good Pitch


Questions to answer when evaluating your idea for pitch:
* Is it novel?
* Can you explain your game in terms of other games?
* Is there an audience?
* Is it feasible?
* Do you have a team capable of completing a project?
* Do you come across as someone who others would want to work with?
* Is this the right opportunity?
* Is this is the right time?
* Is this the right game?

Framing your pitch ([from Rami Ismail](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020877/In-3-Sentences-or-Less)):
* Structure:
  * The lede
  * The body
  * The call to action
* What am I pitching?
* Who am I pitching to?
* Who am I?
* Why am I pitching that?
* Why am I pitching that to you?
* What would you gain from what I'm pitching?
* What would this gain cost?
