# Gameplay Systems

Game systems are the procedual implementations of game mechanics. 
These are typically built on top of the technical subsystems provided by the game engine. 
They are different from the sub-engines or subsystems of phyics, graphics, sound, etc.
These traditional game engine subsystems are used as a foundation for gameplay systems.
Consider Samus Aron's various jumps from [Super Metroid](https://www.metroidwiki.org/wiki/Super_Metroid) on the [Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) (SNES). 
The standard jump requies a composite of the physics, animation, graphics, sound, and input subsystems to preform this basic game mechanic.
This basic jump is factored into many of the layers of design in Super Metroid including level design, enemy attack patterns, and the powerup system.
Notice that each of these systems in the design layer are also built upon the basic affordances of a game engine. 

To see a mastful use of the jump system that explores all of its affordances, watch this [Super Metroid Reverse Boss Order Speedrun by ShinyZeni from AGDQ2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyV3MCR9xk)
