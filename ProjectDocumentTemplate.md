# Role Narrative #

In this section, explain how contents from the class helped direct the main role as well as the sub roles. These should be filled out by the student that was assigned the role. However if the role was shared by others, then anyone who worked in that role can give an explanation. 

If there was content that was pulled from out of class and through self directed resesarch, then talk about that as well and how it impacted the decisions made within that role.

The goal of this section is to give a narrative of how the decisions made were influenced by class content
