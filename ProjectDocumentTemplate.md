# Role Narrative #


Your goal is to describe the work d
In this section, explain how contents from the class helped direct the main role as well as the sub roles. These should be filled out by the student that was assigned the role. However if the role was shared by others, then anyone who worked in that role can give an explanation.  If there was content that was pulled from out of class and through self directed resesarch, then talk about that as well and how it impacted the decisions made within that role. 

Here is a template for you to highlight items of your work:  
*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The background of the game consists of procecurally generated terrain that is produced with Perlin noise. This terrain can be modified by the by the game at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based off the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course.
