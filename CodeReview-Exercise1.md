## Code Style ##

### Description ###
Check the scripts to see if the student code adheres to the dotnet style guide.

If there are sections that don't adhere to the style guide, please peramlink the line of code from Github and justify why the line of code has infractured the style guide.

It should look something like this:

* [description of infraction](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L) - this is the justification.

Here is an example of the permalink drop down on Github.

![Permalink option](./images/permalink_example.png)

Here is another example as well.

* [I go to Github and look at the ICommand script in the ECS189L repo!](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/blob/1618376092e85ffd63d3af9d9dcc1f2078df2170/Projects/CommandPatternExample/Assets/Scripts/ICommand.cs#L5)

### Code Style Infractures ###

#### Put style guide infractures ####

## Best Practices ##

### Description ###

If the student has followed best practices (Unity coding conventions from the StyleGuides document) then feel free to point at these segments of code as examplars. 

If the student has breached the best practices and has done something that should be noted, please add the infracture.


This should be similar to the Code Style justification.

* [description of infraction](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L) - this is the justification.
