## Course Description

This course is about the design and development of nuanced and highly-contextual gameplay systems built on the foundation of traditional game engines. Technical game development has many facets including graphics engines, sound engines, networking, and animation system. Many of these facets are now well-established and are provided for in modern game engines. The focus of this course is on the remaining areas that are difficult to abstract and engineer into game engines as they are depend on the genre or details of a specific game design.

## Materials

Unity version 2018.3.11f1. Download it [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) via the Unity Hub.

### Programming Exercises

The programming exercises consist of projects in Unity in which you will have to implement significant game systems or capabilities. These exercises are to be completed individuallyl and will be worth 10 points each. Each will have two components which are described below with the amount of grade points they are worth:
1. [7] The individual programming assignment.
2. [3] Peer-reviewing the work of another pseudo-randomly assigned student.

*Individual Programming Assignment* - The exercise repositories complete with project descriptions and work specific ations will distributed via GitHub Classroom. You will be responsible for completing the excercise objectives, code quality, and following the best practices as described in class. Final submissions will be made via GitHub classroom.

*Peer-review* - For each programming excercise, each student will perform a peer review for another student's work. The reviewing student will be given access to the repository of another student's submmission for review. The peer-reviewer will make a new branch in the repository named "review" and will be responsible for a code review based on C# style guides, an assessment of how well the submission achieved the objectives of the assignment, and notes for improvement.

### Project

Exciting things TBA.

### Participation and Portfolio

Students are required to attend and participate in class, labs, and their team meetings. Additionally, you can boost your participation points by building a portfolio of your work that is accessible to other via the web.

If permission is granted, personal use and sharing of recordings and any electronic copies of course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes and any classroom discussions online or otherwise) is limited to the personal use of students registered in the course and for educational purposes only, even after the end of the course.

To supplement the classroom experience, lectures may be audio or video recorded by faculty and made available to students registered for this class. Faculty may record classroom lectures or discussions for pedagogical use, future student reference, or to meet the accommodation needs of students with a documented disability. These recordings are limited to personal use and may not be distributed (fileshare), sold, or posted on social media outlets without the written permission of faculty.

Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of any part of a recorded lecture or course materials. or using information for purpose other than the student's own learning is prohibited unless prior authorization is given by the instructor.
