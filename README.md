## Course Description

This course is about the design and development of nuanced and highly-contextual gameplay systems built on the foundation of traditional game engines. Technical game development has many facets including graphics engines, sound engines, networking, and animation system. Many of these facets are now well-established and are provided for in modern game engines. The focus of this course is on the remaining areas that are difficult to abstract and engineer into game engines as they are depend on the genre or details of a specific game design.

## Materials
